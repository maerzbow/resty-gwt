RestyGWT
========

## [resty-gwt 1.2](http://restygwt.fusesource.org/blog/release-1-2.html), un-released
* Bugfix for generic lists. When using a list like ``SomeList<T>`` as implementation
  of ``SomeList<Foo>`` and ``SomeList<Bar>``, only the first implementation was generated.
  (At least) during production run this caused ClassCast Exceptions when the second
  implementation (``SomeList<Bar>``) was in use. 

* Add support for Sending Lists and Sets as repeated parameters.
* Add support for byte data type
* Added JSON support for Unix timestamps and null values.
* create ``Domain`` annotation to be able to identify the information about what domain
  this service affects later on. this can be used to invalidate caching entries by domain. 
* after unsuccessful retrying we will not call ``window.alert`` if there is a callback
  available. instead use onError in this case. 
* no retrying behaviour on 301, 302 or 404, fallback to error handler in this case directly
* call onError in org.fusesource.restygwt.client.callback.FilterawareRetryingCallback
  when there is a !GET error request
* add scoped QueueableRuntimeCache to be able to invalidate a particular ident, e.g.
  a domain scope.
* add definition for org.fusesource.restygwt.annotationresolver
  @see http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/MultiValuedConfigProperties
* add ability to take part of the compilation process by registering 
  ``org.fusesource.restygwt.rebind.AnnotationResolver`` in 
  ``org.fusesource.restygwt.rebind.BindingDefaults``
* add some example for triggering ModelChangeEvent from a MethodCallback

* Added a download profile to find recent scala artifacts. (Hiram Chirino)
* Update the scalate library and its build dependencies. (Jon Buffington)
* Support GWT release 2.2.0. (Jon Buffington)
* Remove execute bits from license text file. (Jon Buffington)

* Convert tabs to spaces. (Hiram Chirino)
* restygwt-25 changed toString() to name() (jroyals)
* added some docu for the attribute annotation (kristian)
* Added: Jackson Annotations which are used by the polymorphic api. They are Apache 2.0 licensed so shouldn't cause a problem form that point of view. (Charlie Mason)
* Added: Polymorphic Sub Classes to the user guide. (Charlie Mason)
* Fixed: Merge conflict with recent upstream changes. (Charlie Mason)
* Added: Added Jackson style polymorphic serialisation and deserialisation. (Charlie Mason)
* Look for @Produces/@Consumes on method and if not found, then look on methods enclosing type. (Jason Dillon)
* Fix compile error. (Hiram Chirino)
* use htmlunit so the integration tests are actually running via invoker (kristian)
* annotate an attribute from a resource to used as PathParam (kristian)
* Added the ability for boolean setters to not only be formatted as isFoo(), but getFoo() and hasFoo(). (jlarsen)
* Fix typo. Also trying to fix. #19 (Hiram Chirino)
* Fix sp (Jason Dillon)
* Fixes issue #16 : RequestException does not handle server 500 responses (Hiram Chirino)
* rename doAction to send. (Hiram Chirino)
* Build the website by default. (Hiram Chirino)
* Fixed autogenned license header (jlarsen)
* Fixed a bug with the RestServicClassCreator where you couldn't have a chained hierarchy of services and added RestActions that will map to the various rest actions available and allow us to inject the RestActions into our application. (jlarsen)
* Better resource path resolution.. (Hiram Chirino)
* More doco. (Hiram Chirino)
* Simplify dispatcher interface slightly. (Hiram Chirino)
* tweaking deployment location. (Hiram Chirino)
* converted static website to be scalate based. (Hiram Chirino)
* Added a @JSONP annotation that can be used to mark methods as using the JSONP protocol. (Hiram Chirino)
* Allow configuring the timeout via @Options (Hiram Chirino)
* Allow configuring the expected status via the Option annotation. (Hiram Chirino)
* allowing the dispatcher to be configured on service interfaces. (Hiram Chirino)
* added missing license headers - Simplified the Dispatcher interface, eliminated the factory since they were easy to convert to stateless singletons. - Dispatcher can now be configured at a per method leve (Hiram Chirino)
* remove the fork notes. (Hiram Chirino)
* pom updates. (Hiram Chirino)
* Introduction of a dispatcher, generated by a DispatcherFactory - Dispatcher can be exchanged by 3rd party code easily => Custom caching rules become possible - The dispatcher also is responsible for the callback used => an implementation of a retrying Callback is supplied. - The Dispatcher is fetched and used in Method.send() - Automatic retrying of callbacks (often connections are flaky) (rbauer)
* factored out the common part of the integration-tests into a parent pom (kristian)
* moved internal maven properties which are recommended by maven3 (kristian)
* Use ${project.* instead of deprecated (Jason Dillon)
* Normalize Resource.path to *not* trail with a "/" so that when resolving relative resource, we can safely insert a "/" separator. This should handle @Path on type + @Path on method better w/o relying on the @Path to add "/". (Jason Dillon)
* Make sure service root always ends with a "/" (Jason Dillon)
* Make sure service root always ends with a "/" (Jason Dillon)
* added support for @Consumes @Produces annotations. (Hiram Chirino)
* basic setup for tests (rbauer)

* added - versioning for gwt and gwt-maven-plugin - 1.6 jdk (rbauer)
* back to original (Raphael Bauer)
* back to original name (rbauer)
