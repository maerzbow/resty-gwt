The [RestyGWT Team](http://restygwt.fusesource.org) is pleased to announce
the release of RestyGWT 1.2. RestyGWT is a
[GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) generator for REST services and a
Jackson style object to JSON encoder/decoder. It makes accessing REST based
JSON services as easy to access as GWT RPC style services.

Release Highlights:

* Add support for @JsonCreator with polymorphic types
* JsonTypeIdResolver Support - Added support for Array wrapping
* Support for generic interfaces and DTO serialization
* Implementation of JAX-RS sub-resource locators with @PathParam annotations - closes #56
* Fix issue#47 with BigInteger roundtrip encoding
* Add support for As.WRAPPER_OBJECT subtype declarations
* Rails style support
* Added XSS protection filters
* Allow part of the arg-object participate in as PathParam and the object goes over the wire
* Allow jsonp call with custom value objects
* Allow collection interfaces as service argument
* Added parameter to pass a HTTP header map to a Resource
* Use parseStrict instead of just parse
* Add support for Sending Lists and Sets as repeated parameters.
* Add support for byte data type
* Added JSON support for Unix timestamps and null values.
* create `Domain` annotation to be able to identify the information about what domain
  this service affects later on. this can be used to invalidate caching entries by domain. 
* add definition for org.fusesource.restygwt.annotationresolver
  @see http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/MultiValuedConfigProperties
* add ability to take part of the compilation process by registering 
  ``org.fusesource.restygwt.rebind.AnnotationResolver`` in 
  ``org.fusesource.restygwt.rebind.BindingDefaults``
